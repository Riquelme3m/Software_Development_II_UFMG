    <div>
        <h1>What is Object Oriented Programming?</h1>
        <p>It's a programming paradigm where the development is driven by objects which communicate to each other where those objects are classes with attributes and methods.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h1>Why OOP?</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Organization</li>
            <li>Readability</li>
            <li>Maintainability</li>
            <li>Reusability</li>
            <li>Scalability</li>
            <li>Collaboration</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h1>What's class?</h1>
        <p>Classes are a user-defined type or in another words blueprint of an object which contains attributes and methods .</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h1>What's an object?</h1>
        <p>An object is the instance of a class , which contains the attributes and methods implemented in that class and perform operations.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h1>What are the main features of OOP?</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Inheritance</li>
            <li>Polymorphism</li>
            <li>Abstraction</li>
            <li>Encapsulation</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h1>What is encapsulation?</h1>
        <p>Encapsulation is the process of wraping attributes and methods within a class restricting direct access to some details.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h1>What is abstraction?</h1>
        <p>Abstraction is the process of hiding complex implementation details and showing only the main features of an object.It allows the users to interact with the objects without needing to understand internal details.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h1>What is polymorphism?</h1>
        <p>Polymorphism is the capacity of a function to behave differently depending on the context.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h1>What are the two types of polymorphism?</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Compile time polymorphism (static polymorphism) which is achieved by <strong>method overloading</strong> or <strong>operator overloading</strong>.</li>
            <li>Run time polymorphism (dynamic polymorphism) which is achieved by <strong>method overriding</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h1>What is inheritance?</h1>
        <p>Inheritance is the process of a class where this class inherits either methods or attributes from another class and reuse them in a relationship parent-child.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h1>What is the difference between a structure and a class in C++</h1>
        <p>In a struct everything is public either attributes or methods . In a class , by default everything is private unless you set otherwise. We usually use struct for implementing data structures such as nodes and so on .</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h1>What is a constructor?</h1>
        <p>A constructor is a function that initializes an object . In C++ it's important to understand the difference between the default constructor that you might set and the constructor with the <strong>member initializer list</strong></p>
        <p>In the default constructor , the attributes are initialized twice ( one for the default initialization ) and one for the one you set , but when you use lists there is not this default initialization which is more efficient.</p>
        <p>A constructor is called every time a new object is created</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h1>What is a destructor?</h1>
        <p>A destructor is a method which is called when either an object goes out of scope or when the keyword delete is called.</p>
        <p>In the example virus , we see a kind of recursion calling the destructors in a chain effect. </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h1>What are access modifiers/operator modifiers ?</h1>
        <p>They are keywords that we use to restric access to methods and attributes in a class . In C++ we have three : </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Private :  Only available within the class</li>
            <li>Public :  Available anywhere</li>
            <li>Protected: Available within the class and for its children</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h1>What is static method and attributes ?</h1>
        <p>When you create a new object , a new memory address is assigned to that object . However, when you create a static method or attribute , this one occupies only one address in memory . Therefore , it means that we can access this methods or attribute from any object created or using the class name itself removing the need to create a new object. Example : static int objectCounter which is incremented by one every time a new object is created</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h1>How much memory a class occupy?</h1>
        <p>A class does not occupy any space in memory since it's only the template/blueprint items are made. Only objects occupy memory.</p>
